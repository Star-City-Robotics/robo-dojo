# Object Oriented Programming

Most of the early programming languages were **Procedural Languages** which
means that the focus on the sequence of instructions.  The data was secondary
to the methods, functions, and subroutinges.  Examples of these languages are
C, FORTRAN, COBOL, and Pascal.

**Object Oriented** programming languages, such as C++ and Java, the focus is
on the data.  The data takes the form of _objects_.  Objects have two primary properties: state and behavior.

State is defined as the variables contained in the object.  Behavior is
how the object can change state or change other object states.  The
behavior of an object is done through methods, also referred to as
_class methods_.
