# Git and GitHub Introduction

## Introduction

When working on a software project with a team of programmers, it is important
to keep track of changes to the source code.  This is important for several
reasons.

First, tracking changes allows for some changes to be rolled back to the 
previous version in cases where the changes were a mistake.  

Second, it allows multiple programmers to work on the same section of code
without one programmer's changes getting overwritten by another programmer's
changes.

The process of tracking changes to source code is called Source Code Management.
Over the decades, software that performs Source Code Management, SCM, has
gotten better and better, adding features and support to make source code
management easier and easier.

## Git

Git is such a software package.  It handles source code management by storing
all the source code and related files on a server.  Each programmer
has their own local copies of the source code on their computer.  When the
programmer has made a complete set of changes and tested those changes, 
the new and modified files are sent to the server.  Programmers
periodically, pick up the changes in the remote server and merge them
with their local copy.

Git is used through the use of a CLI, Command Line Interface, called 
***git***.  The git CLI run from a command prompt:

> \>git status

There are also other user interfaces for git available from third-parties.
VSCode, the editor used by FRC programmers has builtin git functionality.

## GitHub

A git server is necessary to use git.  It is possible to run your own git server.
For small groups, this is usually impractical due to cost and requires a computer
that every member of the project team can access over the Internet.

There are several companies that provide git servers. The one that the SCAROB
team uses is ***GitHub***.  GitHub provides a git server.  It is mostly 
free to use.  The exception is for enterprise level companies are required to 
pay a fee.  Therefore, SCAROB uses this git server for free.

GitHub requires every programmer to have a GitHub Account.  These accounts are
free and allow.
