# Java Primitive Data Types

## Why Java uses its own primitive data types

The Java language makes no assumptions about the physical hardware that it
runs on.  Therefore, it cannot depend on the memory sizes of standard data
types.  Java defines its primitive data types using the only unit of memory
that is guaranteed to exist on all digital computers and that is the single bit.

While some common memory units do exist in computer science such as the byte
and the word.  The number of bits in these units vary from hardware platform
to hardware platforms.  The most common units are 8 bit bytes and 32 bit words.
Older computers used different sizes such as 6 bit bytes, 16 bit words,
60 bit words, and 64 bit word sizes. The 64 bit word is becoming more
popular.  There is also a series of computers that used 24 bit words.

Java eliminates the variation of hardware by defining its using its own
set of primitive data types.  The JVM handles the difference between
Java primitive data types and what the hardware actually uses so the
programming does not have to worry about the portability of the Java code.

## Primitive Data Types

Java only supports signed numerical primitive data types.  This means that
a variable of these types can have positive and negative values.  The two
non-numerical types, **boolean** and **char**, are technically unsigned
values.

### Table 1: Primitive Data Type

| Keyword | Size | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| **byte** | 8 bits | Signed integer |
| **short** | 16 bits | Signed integer |
| **int** | 32 bits | Signed integer, usually the default choice for signed integer values |
| **long** | 64 bits | Signed integer, used when an **int** is too somall |
| **float** | 32 bits | Floating point numbers a.k.a real numbers | 
| **double** | 64 bits | Floating point numbers, a.k.a. real numbers. Used for real numbers that require more significant digits than a **float**|
| **boolean** | ? bits | A logical or boolean value, can be either ***true*** or ***false*** |
| **char** | 16 bits | A Unicode character |

**Note:** The size of the **boolean** is not specified in the Java Language
Specification.  Instead, its size is dependent on the specific JVM it is
running on.  A **boolean** technically only needs a single bit with its
***true*** or ***false*** value.  Java may store multible **boolean** variables
in a single byte or word or it may use a single byte or word to store a
single **boolean** variable.


## Primitive Data Types as Objects

There will come a time where you want to pass a variable of a primitive data
type to a method that only allows objects to passed to it.  Java has a
solution for this.  Java defines classes for each primitive data type.  These
classes are referred to as ***wrapper classes*** because they _wrap_ a
primitive data value in an object.

### Table 2: Wrapper Classes

| Class | Primitive Data Type |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| **Byte** | **byte** |
| **Short** | **short** |
| **Integer** | **int** |
| **Long** | **long** |
| **Float** | **float** |
| **Long**  | **long** |
| **Double** | **double** |
| **Boolean** | **boolean** |
| **Character** | **char** |

With the exception of **int** and **char**, the wrapper classes uses the
primitive data type with the first letter in upper case.
