# Git Repositories

Repositories are the heart of how git manages source control.  Repositories are
where source code and associate files are stored along with changes made to these
files.  Repositories are basically disk storage.  Wherever you have a repository,
disk space is used.

## Remote Repository

There are two types of repositories used in a project.  The first is the remote 
repository.  This is where the primary copy of the source code resides.  This is the 
master code base.  Remote repositories are handled by the git server.  Normally,
the git server is on a remote computer.  In other words, on a computer where 
the programmers are not doing any development.  Our remote repositories 
are on the GitHub.com.

## Local Repository

The other type of repository is a local repository.  Each programmer 
creates one or more local repositories on their personal computer/laptop.  Each local 
repository is initially populated from the remote repository using the ‘git clone’ command, 
more about ‘git clone’ later.  All new code and modified code is done in local repositories. 
All changes to the source code are tested and debugged on the programmers’ laptop. 
The programmer can commit changes to their local repository as they are working on changes.  
Once the new and modified code has been tested and verified and committed to the local 
repository, the changes are then merged with the remote repository.  Once the new code 
has been merged with the remote repository, it becomes available to the other programmers 
on the team.

### Multiple Local Repositories

A programmer may have more than one local repository that is cloned (based on) the
same remote repository.  This is done for multiple reasons.  The primary reason is
that allows the programmer to make different sets of unrelated changes, one set
per local repository.

Another primary reason is that there may be multiple branches (more on branches in
a future lesson) and the programmer has a separate local repository for each branch.
Branches are a way to keep separate developement separate.  For instance, one branch
may be for developing feature A and another branch for developing Feature B.
