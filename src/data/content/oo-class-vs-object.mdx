# Class vs Object

## Introduction

A class is a data type. An object is a variable. The terms are often used
interchangable but they are different. Java is a strict type language
which means that every variable must have a data type. A data type
is used to create the actual object in the program memories.

To truly understand this there are
two parts of a computer program that need to be addressed first.
The compiler or interrupter and how a program is stored in a computer.
This lesson intends to cover compilers and memory before addressing the
difference between class and object.

## Classes

Java is know as a Typed Language. This means that data types are defined,
some by the language and others by the programmer that are know as User Types.

### Primitive Types

In Java, everything is derived from the class Object. There are some types
that are not really objects because they are considered primitive. Examples
would be byte, short, int, long, char, boolean, float, and double. There are
primitive classes used to contain primitive variables. Some examples of them
are PrimitiveType, NumericType, IntegerType, and FloatingPointType.

### Non-Primitive Types

Beyond the primitives, there are lots of other types defined by Java and its
extensive library. A prime example would String. A String holds an array of
char and may encapsulate the length of the array or the number of characters
actually in the array.

### Class Types

In Java source code, the programmer can define their own types. These are
called user-defined data type or UDT and also just User Type. All user
defined data types are classes. Not all classes are defined using the class
keyword. The enum keyword is used to build special kinds of classes that
define a finite set of named values. We will ignore enumeration types for
another paper since all that applies to classes applies to enumerations as well.

A class defines a data structure that contains zero or more data members and
zero or more methods. A class definition in the code is instructions to the
compiler on how to build and use the data structure. When the compiler
encounters a variable of a class, the compiler generates code that does the
following:

- Allocate memory to hold the object either from the Stack or the Heap.
  - In the case of constants and global variables, the memory will come from
    the initialized or uninitialized data segment.
- Call the constructors for each data member to initialize them.
- Calls the class constructor to complete the initialization.
- Returns a reference that is the virtual address of the object.

Once the object has been created and initialize, execution returns to the
next statement in the code.

The information to perform these 4 steps are stored in code and in the
initialized data segment by the compiler. In the data segment, information
such as what type of each data member is as well as a list of static data
members and a list of methods and static methods. The program has access to
this information at run time and can use the information for various tasks.

The class also defines the methods of the class. Like the information stored
about data members, the compiler will store information about each method
contained in the class definition. At a minimum, this information will
include the signature of the method. The signature consists of the method
name, the return type, a list of the data types of each parameter, and the
memory location where the method begins execution. Therefore, two methods
in a class can have the same name so long as they have different signatures.

A class requires one or more constructors. Constructors are methods called
when an instance of a class is created. If no constructors are explicitly
defined in the class, a default constructor that takes zero parameters will
be generated by the compiler. Hence, every class has at least one method even
when it defines none.

A class does not consume any Stack or Heap space. Defining a class does
consume some memory. Each method in the class uses memory in the code segment.
Static data members will be created in the initialized data segment. Static
data members are allocated space in the data segment because only one instance
of the static data member exists regardless of how many instances of a class
are created.

### Objects and Variables

In Java, an object and a variable are often used as interchangeable terms. For
this paper, we will be using the term Object to mean any data, both simple and
structured. The term variable will be discussed in a later section in how a
variable and an object are not exactly the same thing.

An object is created based on a type: a primitive type or a class. Objects of
primitive types, such as int and double, may use shortcuts to bypass come of
the more complex concepts of a data structure. These shortcuts are hidden in
the code by the compiler so we can think of primitive types the same way we
think about classes.

A class by itself cannot be used by the program. In order for the data
structure defined by the class to be used, an object or instance of the class
must first be created. This process is know as creating an instance of a class.
This can be done in several ways in Java. It can be done as a local variable
within a scope. It can be created as a dynamic object using the
**_new_** keyword.

An instance of a class requires memory in either the Stack or the Heap. The
big difference between a class and an instance of that class, a.k.a. an object
of that class, is that the class is the blueprint used to create an object and
the object is what contains data. Another way to put it is that an object has
state which refers to its data. Two objects of the same class can be in
different states if they are not identical copies of each other, have
different data.

In other words, if your program wants to use a class, it must first create
an instance or object of that class. That object is the memory that contains
a set of data [members] and can manipulate that data using the class methods.

#### Static Data, Methods, and Classes

Normally, a class cannot not be used to access anything. There is an
exception that is in accessing itâ€™s static data members and static methods.
Only one instance or object of each static data member exists and it can be
accessed using the format **_className.dataMemberName_**.
The access privilege assigned to the static data member (public, protected,
private) determines who can access the data members directly.

Likewise, static methods of a class can be called using the format
**_className.methodName()_**. The difference between a static method and a
non-static method in a class is that the non-static or regular methods
are passed a hidden parameter, **_this_**, which is used to access all
non-static data members in the object. Remember that each instance of a class
or object contain their own set of those data members also known as state.

There is also the case where a class can be defined as static. A static
class can only contain static data members and static methods. This is a
classic technique for defining global variables in a Java program. No
instances can be created of a static class.

### Variables

This section is one of nitpicking definitions. For most purposes, a variable
and an object can be treated as the same thing. It is only when peeking under
the hood do the two terms have different meanings. Everything revolves around
the use of memory. Every unit of memory has an address that defines its
location in the array of memory. An address is needed to locate and access
any object. In C++ and C, the address is stored in a type called a Pointer.
In C++ and C, the program has direct access to the address in the pointer and
can manipulate it. For instance, take an array of Type T, where Type is any
class, the address to the first element of the array is provided to the
program. To figure out the address of the Nth element in the array, where N
starts at 0 for the first element, use the following formula:

> address = N\*sizeof(Type)  
> which is equivalent to T[N]

In Java, pointers and addresses are consider too dangerous to use and are
therefor hidden from the programmer. Pointers and address are hidden but
are still used.

The name of an object is the variable that references it. For instance,
take Type foobar. If Type is not a primitive type, foobar will actually
contain the address of the object of Type. If foobar is an array of Type,
foobar contains the address or pointer to the first element of the array.

#### Passing Parameters

There are two ways in which parameters can be passed to a method or function.
One is by value and the other is by reference. In the first case, a completely
new object is created on the Stack. This involves calling the class
constructor and making a copy of all the data members. When passing by
reference, only the address of the object is pushed onto the Stack.
Passing by reference is faster than passing by value, especially if the
class constructor is complicated. Passing by value insures that anything
done to the parameter in the method does not change the original object in
the calling method. There are trade offs to be considered when deciding
to pass an parameter by value or reference.

In Java, all parameters are passed by value. The value passed is whatever
is stored in the variable. If that is a primitive data type, then the value
of the data type is duplicated. If the variable is to a complex object, such
as an array, the variable contains the reference and the reference is duplicated.

### Access Modifiers

In every class definition, the class itself, all of its data members, and
all of its methods must be assigned an access level by using an access
modifier. If no access level is specified, a default level will be assigned.
There are three access modifiers used in Java: public, protected, and private.

Figure 2 shows the three different access modifiers and how they affect access
to data and members within an object. Basically, the access levels are:

- Accessed directly by any code within the class itself.
- Access directly by any subclass.
- Access directly by any other class in the same package.
- Access by any other class regardless of package.

## Conclusion

The terms Class and Object are often used interchangeable even though they are
two distinct things. The Class is the blueprint of the type while an object
is an instance of the type. A Class uses no Stack or Heap space. An Object
uses either Stack or Heap space.

Another way to look at is that a Class defines an Object and an Object is an
individual container of data and methods that is accessed by the executing
program.
