# Doxygen - A Documentation Tool

## Introduction

Doxygen is a tool that turns comments in source code into documentation.
Javadoc comments, part of the Java Language, are basically a subset of
Doxygen comments.  Doxygen can generate documentation is different
formats: HTML which looks like Javadoc output,
LaTex, man pages, RTF (Rich Text Format), XML, and Docbook.

While Javadoc is limited to Java only, Doxygen can be used on most languages
including, and not limited to, Java, C++, C, FORTRAN, PHP, and Python.

## Doxygen Comments

Doxygen reads doxygen comments for the source of the generated documentation.
Doxygen uses various commenting styles that each of its supported languages
use.  Like Javadoc, the comment style:

```
/**
 * … text …
 */
```

The double asterisk denotes the beginning of a doxygen comment.  This style
also works for C++ and other languages that use C-Style comments.  Other
comment styles can be used to denote doxygen comments.  See
[https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
for more details.

Doxygen looks for commands within the doxygen comment that tell how that
section of the comment is to treated.  Commands begin with the character
‘@’ or ‘\’.  For best practices, chose one of the two characters and use
only that one in your code.  See
[https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html)
for list of all the Doxygen commands.

## Where to use Doxygen Comments

There are no hard rules for when and where to place doxygen comments though
there are a few places where they are most useful.

The important doxygen comments to include in the source code are:

- At the top of the file.  This comment should be used to state what
classes are defined within the file, the purpose of this file (especially
if it contains more than one class), list of authors (there are doxygen tags
for that), copyright, and any other useful informatin.
- Just before any class.  This comment should document the purpose of the
class and its parant class (if any), and any other useful information.
- Before any data members where it is important to know how that variable
will be used.  Sometimes, one doxygen comment may be used for a group of
related data members.
- Before each and every method.  This is probably the most important set
of comments because these comments gives a brief description of the method
(should be one line), a list of parameters passed to the method (using the
***@param*** tag), a description of what the method is suppose to do, the
return value, and a list of any exceptions that can be thrown by the method.
- Other places in the code where it may be useful to document.
  - A useful doxygen comment to use is the ***@todo***.  These comments
    are used to mark places in the code where more coding is needed that
	is to be added later.

Example:
```
	if ( arg == null )
	{
		/**
		 * @todo Add Error Handling for illegal argument.
		 */
	}
```

**Note:** the @brief tag can be omitted if javadoc_autobrief is enabled,
which Doxygen calls ***BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC***, is enabled.  In this case, the
first line or sentence in the doxygen comment is assumed to the the @brief line.

### Files

Each file should start with a doxygen comment that contains the following:

```
/**
 * @brief A short description of the purpose of the file.  One sentence preferred.
 * @file <filename> (optional)
 *
 * Description of what the file contains and is for.  This is the full
 * length description of what the @brief description is saying.  It can
 * be any length and multiple paragraphs.
 *
 * @author  Author1
 * @author  Author2
 * @author  AuthorN
 *
 * @data    (This is useful IF GIT fills it in when the file is committed.)
 * @version <version number>
 *
 * @copyright 2025 by FRC Team 10004 SCAROB, All rights reserved.
 */
````

### Classes

There should be a doxygen comment before every class that is declared in
the code.  Variations of this type of doxygen comment should be before any
type definition such as enum declarations as well as classes.

```
/**
 * @brief A brief description of the purpose of this definition.
 *
 * Description of class. What is its purpose and intended use. 
 * Include information that a user of the class might need such as:
 *
 *   - Pre-conditions needed before creating an instance of this class
 *   - Post-conditions that might be needed when done using this class
 *   - is the class thread-safe or not
 *   - is this class a singleton in which only one instance of the class
 *     may exist.
 *   - What resources this class could use and which resources are not
 *     shareable.
 */
 ```
 
### Variables and objects

Anytime a variable or object is defined, a doxygen comment should be used
if there is any information about the it that another programmer should know.
If the variable is named properly, the doxygen comment may be unnecessary.
Things to keep in mind for information that should go into a doxygen comment:

- Does the value of this object effect other objects or is this object effected by other objects?  In other words, does this object interact with other objects.  
  - Example: If this object is true, that object values are ignored.
  - Example: This object is the lock for that object.  Useful information when a set of objects are designed to be access on multiple threads.
  - Is the value expressed in terms of units such as seconds, meters, meters/second?
  - What conditions causes the object to change.

```
/**
 * Description of variable or object
 */

public type variable;
```

### Methods

Methods, also called functions and subroutines depending on the language,
are code that can be executed for other places in the program by being called.
The first part of a method is the signature which includes scope (public,
protected, private), the return value, the method name, a list of arguments
that are passed to the method, a list of exceptions that can be thrown.
This is the part of the method that comes before the body of executable
statements.

The signature of a method is a contract to the caller.  It is this contract
that should be described in the doxygen comment just before the method.  The
caller does not need to know how the method performs its task.  The caller
does need to know what the outcome of that task is.  For instance, are there
any preconditions that need to be met before calling this method?  What are
the post-conditions that the caller should know about when the method returns?
What exceptions may be thrown that the caller might want to catch and handle.

```
/**
 * @brief Short description of method
 *
 * Long description of method.
 *
 * @param argument1  Description
 * @param argument2  Description
 *  …
 * @param argumentN  Description
 *
 * @return Description of return value 
 *
 * @pre    Description of any per-conditions that the caller is expected
 *         to meet before calling this method.
 *
 * @post   Description of any post-conditions the caller should expect
 *         to have occurred while this method is running.
 *
 * @throws <ExceptionType1> Description on why this exception might
 *                          get thrown.
 * @throws <ExceptionTypeN> Description on why this exception might
 *                          get thrown.
 */

public type  foobar(argument1, argument2, ..., argumentN)
{
}
 ```

### Todo Lists

One useful feature of Doxygen is that you can generate Todo lists by
using the @todo command.  These doxygen comments can go anywhere in the
source code files.  They can be used to mark sections of code that still
need to be written.  Areas where the code needs extensive testing.  And
for any other tasks that have not been completed.

```
try
{
	… code …
}
catch (Exception exc)
{
	/**
	* @todo write error handling code for …
	*/
}
```


### Other Usages

There are other times where doxygen comment can be used within the code.
For example, if a section of code was written using one algorithm over
another, a useful doxygen comment would list the algorithms that could
have been used and why one was selected over the others.  This is helpful
to future programmers who might try to replace the code with code using
a different algorithm that might not work as well.


## Diagrams

Doxygen can also be used to generate various diagrams useful in understanding
the relationship between classes and how the program flows.  The three most
useful diagrams are:

- Class Diagrams which show class inheritance and which classes interact with each other.
- Call Diagrams which show what classes are used by a class.
- Caller Diagrams which show which classes used this class.
	
In order to generate these diagrams, Doxygen makes uses of another program,
GraphViz.  GraphViz may need to be installed separately.

One import configuration to enable (set to YES) when generating diagrams
is the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS in the Doxyfile configuration file.  This
causes the diagrams to be hidden in the final HTML output.  The diagrams
can be large, covering several screens or pages.  This option allows for
the diagrams to be viewed by clicking on a link in the documentation.
The diagrams will then be displayed inline instead of in another window.

## Doxywizard

Doxygen requires a configuration file usually called Doxyfile or .doxyfile,
the name changes with operating systems.  You can also specify your own name
for this file.  The configuration file contains many options and can be
rather daunting to new users.  Doxygen provides a GUI interface that can
be used to both set up your configuration and run doxygen.  The GUI is
called doxywizard.  On Linux, this program is usually run from the command line.

Doxywizard has two modes, available from tabs in the GUI.  The first mode
is Wizard.  This should be the first mode used for configuring doxygen.
It allows you to set where the source code resides, where the output
documentation should go, and what diagrams should  be generated.

The second mode is Expert.  In this mode, all the options are presented to
you.  The options are grouped into common areas such as Project,
HTML (output), and DOT (Diagram graphics).  Once the basic configuration
file is set with the Wizard, the Expert mode is useful for tweaking the
configuration.  One such tweak that I recommend is in the HTML section,
enable ***HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS***.

In Expert mode, hover the mouse over an option and a description of what
the option controls will appear in the lower left corner of the GUI.

Remember to save the configuration file that you generated before exiting doxywizard.  Use the top menu **FILE→SAVE** or **FILE→SAVE AS**.

## Best Practices

Doxygen can be run from anywhere on your computer.  It is best to create 
a directory or folder that Doxygen can use as a working directory.  The
working directory is where Doxygen stores files and temporary files.
There will be a lot of files generated so you do not want this happening
within your project directories.

My recommendation is to create a subdirectory or subfolder in the root
directory of your project.  My preference is to use the name Doc, if it
is not already used by the project, or Doxy (or doxy) if Doc is already
used or you want to reserve a Doc directory for later.  Store your
configuration file in the doxy directory.

This is the directory to use when doxywizard asks for the working directory.
I use the doxy directory as the directory where doxygen should put the
generated documentation.  You can use a different directory for the output
though you should make sure that it is directory that you can delete without
losing any important files.  Doxygen will create subdirectories in the
output documentation directory for each time of document it generates:
html, man, docbook, etc.

## Installation

There are two components that need to be downloaded and installed.
Instructions for downloading and installing for your operating system
can be found at:

- Doxygen and Doxywizard
  - [https://www.doxygen.nl](https://www.doxygen.nl)
  - These are the main components needed to run doxygen.
- GraphViz
  - [https://graphviz.org](https://graphviz.org)
  - Used to draw the dot diagrams generated by Doxygen when it
    scans the source code.  These diagrams are generated regardless
	of whether there are any doxygen comments in the file.
