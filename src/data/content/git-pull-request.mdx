# Pull Request

The purpose of a child branch is to do development without modifying
the parent branch.  Such development can be to develop a new release
version of a program, add a new feature, or fix a bug.  Once this
purpose has been reached, it is time to merge the changes in the
child branch into its parent branch.

The process of merging a child branch back into its parent branch is
full of issues that must be resolved before the changes can be successfully
merged.

The first of these is merge conflicts.  The second is whether the changes
are safe to add to the parent branch.  To protect the parent branch 
many Git-based platforms such as GitHub provide the functionality of
a ***pull request*** also known as a ***PR***.

A pull request is initiated from the GitHub website.  First go to the
GitHub page for the repository that you are working with.  In the menu
near the top of the page, look for the *Pull request* item and click
on it.  Follow the instructions on the Pull request page.

Another person on the programming team needs to approve the pull
request before the actual merger can take place.  Depending on the changes
being merged, there may be a selected list of people who can approve
the pull request.  In large development team, these people are usually
the project manager and project architect and sometimes other senior
people on the project.  It is their responsibility to do a code review
of the changes.  They also can request that the programmer who submitted
the pull request to fix or change things.  These changes can range 
from formatting standards to conflicts with other tasks being worked 
on within the project team.
