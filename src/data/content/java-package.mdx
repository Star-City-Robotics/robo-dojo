# Package

## Introduction

One of the problems in programming is identifier conflicts.  This conflict
arises when two or more elements have the same identifier or name.  This
is not allowed in programming because the compiler or interpretor cannot
determine which element is being referenced.

It is up to the programmers it make sure that the same identifier is not
used for multiple elements within the program.  The problem comes when
a program uses third party libraries or Java libraries.  The programmer
has no control of what identifiers were used in third party code.

For example, let say the program has a class called Shape which is the
parent or base class for classes such as Square, Triangle, and Circle.
The class Shape may also be declared in third party code.  When this
occurs, the source code cannot be compiled successfully.

## Package

Java solution to identifier conflict also known as identifier resolution
is to place source code into packages.  A package can be thought as a
container of related software.  The compiler will automatically use
the package name and the identifier together to create a unique name
for the element.

## Unique Package Naming

The is no way to strictly enforce the use of unique package names. therefore
there is a convention used by Java Programmers to hopefully come up with
a unique package name.

In most cases, every programming project is associated with an Internet
Domain.  The convention is to use that reverse of the domain name.  This
does not mean completely reversing the letters and dots.  It means that
each component of the domain name is used and appear in the reverse order.
Added to the end of that sequence, could be team and/or project name,
followed by subproject names.

>***\<reverse domain\>.\<team\>.\<project\>.\<subproject\>***

For example, let the domain name used for a project is _my.domain.com_, the
team name is _SCAROB_, the project is _Cresendo_, and the subproject is the
drive system.  This could result in a package name of:

>***com.domain.my.scarob.cresendo.drivesystem***
