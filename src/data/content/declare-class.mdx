# Classes

## Introduction

The most important part of programming in Java and other object oriented
languages is the **Class**.  In writing a Java program, you declare a
class.  A class is then used to define variables and objects.  When something
is declared, the element is used by the compiler while the code is being
compiled. When an element is defined, memory is allocated for it in the
running program's memory.

A class is a data type.  The class declaration tells the compiler how
to create an object of that class type.  The declaration states what
data members are in each object, what data members are shared between
all objects of that type, what methods are contained in each object that
have direct access to the data members, and which methods are shared
by all objects of that class type.

**Note:** An ***object*** is also called an ***instance***.  While the
two terms mean the same, the ***instance*** implies that there are
objects of the same class type.

## Declaring a class

The following code example shows the basic form of a class.  We are
assuming that ***OtherClass*** is a class type declared elsewhere.

### Example Code 1

```
/**
 * Class Documentation comment.
 */
public class MyClass
{
	private int         size;
	private OtherClass  data;

    public MyClass()
	{
		this.size = 0;
		this.data = null;
	}

    public MyClass( int mysize, OtherClass mydata )
	{
		this.size = mysize;
		this.data = mydata;
	}

	public int getSize()
	{
		return this.size;
	}

	public void setSize( int newSize )
	{
		this.size = newSize;

		return;
	}

	private boolean haveData()
	{
		// See ternary operator in the lesson on Java Operators
		return ( (this.data != null) ? true : false ;
	}

	public int foobar()
	{
	   if ( !haveData )
	   {
			// Throw exception because we cannot get the information
	   }

	   return data.getValue();
	}


}  // end of MyClass
```

### Class Documentation

Every class declaration should start with a comment that describes what
the class is, what is it used for, and any other useful information.

This comment is optional though it is strongly recommended since the
class will be used by other programmers and other programmers may also
modify this class declaration.

It is also strongly recommend to use Doxygen tags in this comment so
that documentation can be generated without having to write the same
information in more than one place.

### Class Statement

The class statement begins with the line of code that specifies the
identifier for the class.  In its basic form, the syntax of this
statement is:

>\<access modifier\> **class** \<ClassName\>

There are four access modifiers available in Java: ***public***,
***protected***, ***private***, and no modifier, which is referred
to as the default access.  More information will be provided in
the lesson on ***Access Control***.

For now, the two access modifiers that will be used in this lesson
are ***public*** which means that everyone can access it and
***private*** which means that only software inside the class can
access it.

There are other variations of the class statement that will be
discussed in future lessons.

### Data Members

Data members are variables contain in each object of this class.  They
can be primitive data types like int or boolean or they can objects.

The syntax is:

>\<access modifier\> \<data type\> \<identifier\> [ = \< value \>];

Data members can be ***private*** so that they can only be accessed
from within the class code, and they can be ***public*** so that any
other code can access them by using the object identifier dot data
member identifier.  The ***protected*** and default access modifier
will be discussed in the lesson on ***Access Control***.

There is a missing optional keyword in the syntax.  That is the keyword
***static***, which can be placed before the data type or before the
access modifier.  A static data member only exists once and is shared
between all the instances of the class.  Each object has access
to a static data member.

The ***[]*** represent an optional part of the statement.  A variable
can be assigned a value in the declaration.  This will cause the data
member to be initialized when the object is first created, before any
other code (See ***Constructors*** below).  In the case of a static
data member, it is initialized when the program loads.  Therefore,
a static data member must be assigned a value when it is declared.

Data members are usually declared at the beginning of a class declaration
though they can be placed anywhere in the class between methods.

### Constructors

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize each
object when it is created.  Constructor methods do not have a return
value as other methods have and their identifiers are the same as
the class identifier.

Almost always a constructor has the ***public*** access modifier.  If
it does not only an instance of the class can create an instance.  The
instance that creates the other instances cannot be created.  There
are cases where the ***private*** access modifer can be used under
very specific conditions.  The use of ***private*** constructors
will be explained in the ***Singleton Pattern*** lesson (to be written).

A class can have more than one constructor so long as the list of
parameters passed to it are different.  The compiler can determine
which constructor to use based on the parameters used in creating
a new object.

The constructor with no parameters is know as the default constructor.

There are also specialty constructors such as the copy or assignment
constructor which has a single parameter that is an object of the
same class type.

*** Methods

Methods are functions that are declared with a class.  They are the
code that results in the behavior of each object.

Syntax:

```
[static] <access modifier> <data type> <identifier> ( [<parameters>] )
{
	// some code
}
```

The ***static*** keyword is optional.  When it is not present, the
method is a class method with access to all data members and methods
declared in the class, including the ones marked ***private***.
There is actually one one copy of a class method code stored in
the running program memory.  In order to access other methods and
data members in an object, the method is passed a hidden parameter
named ***this***.  An element declared within a class can always
be referenced by `***this***.\<identifier\> if any identifier resolution
issues arise.

When the ***static*** keyword is present, no hidden parameter is passed
to the static method.  Therefore as static method cannot access any
non-static data members or methods declared in the class.  It can access
any static data member or static method in the class.

A common use for static methods is in a class that provides utility
methods.  An example is the class Math which provides static methods
to square a number or raise a number to a power.

The identifier should be unique within the class.  The exception
to this rule is that there can be several methods using the same
identifier so long have a different ***signature*** which in this case
would depend on unique lists of parameters.  While the return type
is also part of a method signature, this may not resolve the
conflict since one data type returned could be automatically
converted to another data type.
This is known as ***overloading***.  It is strongly recommended to
only overload methods that do the same thing even if they do it
in different ways.

The parameters, when present is a comma separated list of data type
identifier combinations.  If no parameters are passed, the method
declaration is an empty set of paratheses, ***()***.

### Best Practice Tip

#### End Comments

When coding large blocks where a block begins and ends with a curly bracket,
***{}***, it is recommend to place a comment at the end of the block so
that it is easy to know what the ending bracket belongs to.

When is a block large?  IMHO, a block is large and should have and end
comment when both the beginning and ending brackets cannot fit on the
screen of your editor.
