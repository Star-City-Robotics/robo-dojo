# Commiting

As you modify code and add code in your local repository, these changes
are not actually in the local repository.  In other words, the local repository
does not know what the new changes are. 

Modified and new files must be commited to the local repository.  This is done
with two commands: ***git add*** and ***git commit***.  The add command marks
which files are to commited.  A list of new and modified files can be listed
using the ***git status*** command.

Once one or more files have been flagged for being commited, run the
***git commit*** command.  This command will request a message that describes
the changes made.  When this command is run, git will make a snapshot of the
current changes being commited, store the commit message and create a set
of deltas or patches that allow for any future attempt to get a copy of
the branch at one of the previous commit nodes.

Files that are commited to the local repository can only been seen on the
local repository.  In order for other programmers to see these changes, the
remote repository will need to be updated.  This is done using the
***git push*** command.  This command will sync the remote repository with
the local repository.

See the ***Git CLI Commands*** lesson for details on the git commands
listed above.
