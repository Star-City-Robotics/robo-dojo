# Blockquotes

Blockquotes are perfect for **highlighting important information**, **citations**, and **callout sections** in your Markdown documents.

## Basic Blockquote Syntax

### Simple Blockquote

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

**Result:**

> This is a blockquote.

### Multi-line Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a longer blockquote that spans
> multiple lines. Each line starts with
> the greater-than symbol.
```

**Result:**

> This is a longer blockquote that spans
> multiple lines. Each line starts with
> the greater-than symbol.

### Lazy Formatting

```markdown
> You can also write blockquotes
> like this, where only the first line
> needs the > symbol.
```

**Result:**

> You can also write blockquotes
> like this, where only the first line
> needs the > symbol.

## Nested Blockquotes

### Multiple Levels

```markdown
> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.
```

**Result:**

> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

### Deep Nesting

```markdown
> Level 1
>
> > Level 2
> >
> > > Level 3
> > >
> > > > Level 4
```

**Result:**

> Level 1
>
> > Level 2
> >
> > > Level 3
> > >
> > > > Level 4

## Blockquotes with Formatting

### Formatted Text

```markdown
> **Important:** This is a _crucial_ point to remember.
>
> You can use `code` and other formatting inside blockquotes.
```

**Result:**

> **Important:** This is a _crucial_ point to remember.
>
> You can use `code` and other formatting inside blockquotes.

### Lists in Blockquotes

```markdown
> ## Key Points
>
> 1. First important point
> 2. Second important point
> 3. Third important point
>
> - Additional note
> - Another consideration
```

**Result:**

> ## Key Points
>
> 1. First important point
> 2. Second important point
> 3. Third important point
>
> - Additional note
> - Another consideration

### Code in Blockquotes

````markdown
> Here's how to use the function:
>
> ```javascript
> function greet(name) {
>   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
> }
> ```
>
> Remember to handle edge cases.
````

**Result:**

> Here's how to use the function:
>
> ```javascript
> function greet(name) {
>   return `Hello, ${name}!`;
> }
> ```
>
> Remember to handle edge cases.

>
> > **Alice:** That sounds good. What about refresh tokens?
> >
> > **Bob:** Yes, we should implement those for better security.
```

**Result:**

## Best Practices

### 1. Use for Emphasis

Use blockquotes to highlight important information:

✅ **Good:**

```markdown
> **Important:** Always backup your data before making changes.
```

❌ **Overuse:**

```markdown
> This is regular content that doesn't need emphasis.
>
> > This is also regular content.
> >
> > > And this too.
```

### 2. Keep It Readable

Don't overcomplicate nested blockquotes:

✅ **Clear:**

```markdown
> Main point
>
> > Supporting detail
```

❌ **Confusing:**

```markdown
> > > > Too many levels make it hard to read
```

### 3. Consistent Formatting

Use consistent styles for similar content:

✅ **Consistent:**

```markdown
> 💡 **Tip:** First helpful tip

> 💡 **Tip:** Second helpful tip
```
