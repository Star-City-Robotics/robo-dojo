# Git Branching

## What is a Branch

Branching is a technique used in SCM to allow different versions of the same
source code to exist in a single repository.  A branch is a complete set of
all the source code files and associated files that form one version of
the source code.

Every repository has at least one branch.  That branch is usually named ***main*** 
in a git repository.  All other branches derive from ***main*** or branches derived
from ***main***.  In this sense, ***main*** is the root branch.  The ***main*** 
branch is also referred to as the ***Master Branch***.

A branch contain a sequence of changes called ***commits*** (see next lesson for
more details on commits).  A branch can be represented as a line with a series of
dots or circles.  Each dot or circle represents a commit to the branch.

A new branch is created as a copy of its parent branch from the most recent commit
on the parent branch.  The most recent commit is referred to as the ***head*** of the
branch.  The new branch is also called a ***child branch***.

When the code in the branch is working and tested, the code can be merged back into
its parent branch, through a ***pull request*** (see future lesson for more details
on GitHub Pull Requests).

Likewise, the branch can be brought up to date with its parent branch by pulling
or fetching the changes made to parent branch since the branch was created or
the last time changes were fetched.  This is merging the parent branch into the
\[child\] branch.

## Why use Branches

Branches are used to isolate code changes that is under development and therefore
may break the current release of the software.  Development can occur on a child
branch without damaging the release branch.  Once the development is done and the
code has been tested, the development \[child\] branch can be merged back into
the release \[parent\] branch.

Branches can also be used to separate the development of new features that are
independent of each other.  This allows one group of programers to work on one
feature while other groups of programmers work on other features.

Another use of branches is to allow the support of previous releases of the
software.  Each release would have its own ***Master Branch***.  This allows
for bug fixes to applied to older releases while still developing the next
release.
