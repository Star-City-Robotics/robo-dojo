# Variables

## Introductions

A variable is any data that is stored in memory and has an identifier or name.
The data is either an object or a primitive data type such as int and boolean.

Java is a strict typing language which means that all variables must be a
data type.  That data type can be a primitive data type or a class.

All variables are declared inside class data types.  In other words,
there are no global variables allowed in Java.  The closest thing in
Java to a global variable is a static data member defined in a class.
Such a variable can be referenced as:

>***\<class type\>.\<variable identifier\>***

## Declaring Variables

Every variable must be declared before it can be used.  Every variable
must be defined before it can be used.  The first step is the is to
declare the variable.  This step tells the compiler how to create
and initialize the variable at the appropriate time.

The syntax for declaring a variable is:

>***[static] \<access modifier\> \<data type\> \<identifier\> 
[ = \<value\>]***

### static

The static keyword is optional, hence being in square brackets.  
A static variable can be modified.  The static keyword means that
there is only one instance of the variable shared between all the
objects of that class type.

### Access Modifier

The possible access modifiers are: ***public***, ***protected***,
***private***, and default access.  The access modifer determines
what other code can access the variable directly.

See the lesson on Access Modifiers for more details.

### Data Type

Any data type can be used.  The data type must be known to the
compiler.  This restricts the data types to primitive data types,
class data types defined in the same package, and class data types
imported from other packages.

### Identifier

Any valid identifer can be used so long as it is unique within the
class declaration.

### Initialion

A variable can be initialize where it is being declared.  This is
done by using an equal sign followed by an expression.  The
expression is evaluated to the value.  The expression can be
a constant, an object, a new object, or an expression whose
evaluated value matches the variable's data type.

Initializing in a variable declaration is optional except in
the case of static variables.  Static variables must be initialized
in the declaration statement.  This is because static variables
are defined when a program starts running, before any object of
the class type is defined.

All non-static variables are initialized when the object is defined,
when it is created.  These data member variables can be initialized
by the value in their declaration statements or by the class
construct.
