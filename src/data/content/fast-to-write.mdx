# Fast to Write

One of Markdown's greatest strengths is how **incredibly fast** it is to write compared to other markup languages or rich text editors.

## Speed Comparison

### HTML vs Markdown

Writing a simple heading and paragraph in HTML:

```html
<h1>My Article Title</h1>
<p>
  This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.
  Here's a <a href="https://example.com">link</a>.
</p>
```

The same content in Markdown:

```markdown
# My Article Title

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and _italic text_. Here's a [link](https://example.com).
```

**Result**: Markdown is 60% shorter and much more readable!

## Why Markdown is Faster

### 1. Minimal Syntax

- No opening and closing tags
- Simple punctuation-based formatting
- Natural reading flow

### 2. Keyboard-Friendly

- No need to reach for mouse/trackpad
- All formatting done with keyboard shortcuts
- Continuous typing flow

### 3. Intuitive Symbols

| Format | Markdown      | HTML                     |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Bold   | `**text**`    | `<strong>text</strong>`  |
| Italic | `*text*`      | `<em>text</em>`          |
| Link   | `[text](url)` | `<a href="url">text</a>` |
| Code   | `` `code` ``  | `<code>code</code>`      |

### Time-Saving Habits
