# Java Operators

Operators are special symbols used to perform specific operations on one
or more objects.  They are the basic way of manipulating data.

Java has several categories of operators based on their functionality.

## Operands

Before describing the various operators used in Java, we need to know the
terminology.  Every operator requires one or two operands.  If the operand
appears to the left of the operator, it is called a ***left operand***.
If the operand appears to the right of the operator, it is called a
***right operand***.

An operand is a constant, a variable/object, or an expression.  An operand,
with its left and right operands forms an expression and the value of
the expression is the results of the operator.  An expression is always
evaluated and the resulting value is used.

## Use of parentheses

Parentheses, "**()**", are used to define the order in which operations
are performed.  There are rules that define the order of operations when
parentheses are not used.  It is easy to make mistakes on what the order
of operations will result in so the use of parentheses makes the code
easier to control.

Will `2 + 3 * 4` evaluate to 20 or 14?  Using parentheses makes it easier
to read the code.  In other words, `(2 + 3) * 4` is 20 while `2 + (3 * 4)`
is 14.

Based on Java's ***order of operations***, the expression `2 + 3 * 4` is
14 because __*__ has a higher order than __+__ and is done first.  Operators
at the same level or order are evaluated left to right.

## Arithmetic Operators

As the name implies, arithmetic operators perform mathematical functions.
These operators take two variables, called ***operands***, and performs
the appropriate mathematical operations.  Neither of the operands are
changed.  The results of the mathematical operation is used in place of the
expression.

**Note:** Operands are referred to _left operand_ and _right operand_ based
on which side of the operator they reside.

### Table 1: Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Purpose | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| **+** | addition | Adds two operands and returns the sum. For example: 7.5 + 8.5 ==> 16.0 |
| **-** | subtraction | Subtracts the right operand from the left operand. For example: 10 - 13 ==> -3 |
| __*__ | multiplication | Multiplys two operands and returns the product.  For example:  2 * 5 ==> 10 |
| **/** | division | Divides the left operand from the right operand and returns the results.  In the case of integer division, any remaining fraction is truncated (ignored) For examples:  12 / 5 ==> 2 and 12.0 / 5.0 ==> 2.4 |
| **%** | modulo | Performs division between two integer values and returns the remainder of the operation.  For example: 12 % 5 ==> 2 |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to set a value to the left operand.  There may be
additional mathematical operations performed to determine what the value is.

In a sense, there is only one assignment operator and it is the __=__.  The
rest of the assignment operators use two symbols, a mathematical operator
and the __=__.  These are short cuts for `A Z= B` ==> `A = (A Z B)` where **Z**
is the mathematical operator.  In these cases, the value is obtained using
the origanal value of the left operand, _A_ in this case.

**Note:** Restriction: The left operator of an assignment operator must be
a variable or object.  It cannot be a constant or an expression because
the value of a constant or an expression cannot be changed.

### Table 2: Assignment Operators

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| __=__ | Changes the left operand to the value of the right operand.  | A = B | 
| __+=__ | Changes the left operand to the value of the expression of the left operand added to the right operand. | A = (A + B) |
| __-=__ | Changes the left operand to the value of the expression of the right operand subtracted from the left operand. | A = (A - B) |
| __*=__ |  Changes the left operand to the value of the expression of the left operand multiplied by the right operand. | A = (A * B) |
| __/=__ | Changes the left operand to the value of the expression of the left operand divided by the right operand. | A = (A / B) |
| __%=__ | Changes the left operand to the value of the expression of the left operand modulo the right operand. | A = (A % B) |

## Boolean Operators

Boolean operators perform boolean operations on two operands.  When an
expression using boolean operators is evaluated, the results is either
***true*** or ***false***.

### Table 3: Boolean Operators

| Symbol | Purpose | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| __==__ | equal to | Compares two operands.  If they have the same value, a ***true*** is returned. |
| __!=__ | not equal to | Compares two operands.  If they are not the same value, a ***true*** is returned. |
| __&gt;__ | greater than | Compares two operands and returns ***true*** if the left operand has a greater value than the right operand. |
| __&lt;__ | less than | Compares two operands and returns ***true*** if the left operand has a lesser value than the right operand |
| __&gt;=__ | greater than or equal to | Compares two operands and returns ***true*** if the right operand is less than the left operand.  This is equivalent to _not less than_.  |
| __&lt;=__ | less than or equal to | Compares two operands and returns ***true*** if the right operand is greater than the left operand.  This is equivalent to _not greater than_. |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators performs boolean operations on boolean operands or expressions
that evaluate to a boolean value.

The evaluation of a logical operator expression only returns ***true*** or ***false***.

Logical operators do not change any variable or object. They just return a boolean value.

### Table 4: Logical Operators

| Symbol | Purpose | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| __&&__ | Logical AND | Returns ***true*** only if both the operands are ***true***. |
| __\|\|__ | Logical OR  | Returns ***true*** if one or both of the operands is ***true*** |
| __!__  | Logical NOT | Returns the opposite boolean value of the right operand.  This operator only uses a right operand. |

## Unary Operators

Unary Operators operator on a single operand.  The behavior of the operation
will vary depending on whether the operand is a left or right operand.

Both the increment and decrement operators will change the value of its operand.

### Table 5: Unary Operators

| Symbol | Purpose | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| __+__  | unary plus |  This is an advance operator that will not be discussed here. |
| __-__  | unary minus | This is an advance operator that will not be discussed here. |
| __++__ | increment | The behavior of this operator depends on whether a left operand or a right operand is used.  In both cases, the operand value is incremented by 1.  In the case of a left operand, `variable++`, the original value of the variable is returned and then the variable is incremented by 1. This is known as ***post-increment***.  In the case of the right operand, `++variable`, the variable is incremented by 1 and the new value is returned.  This is known as ***pre-increment***  |
| __--__ | decrement | The behavior of this operator depends on whether a left operand or a right operand is used.  In both cases, the operand value is decreased by 1.  In the case of a left operand, `variable--`, the original value of the variable is returned and then the variable is decreased by 1. This is known as ***postfix decrement***.  In the case of the right operand, `--variable`, the variable is decreased by 1 and the new value is returned.  This is known as ***prefix decrement***  |
| __!__  | Logical NOT | This is the same logical operator described above.   Returns the opposite boolean value of the right operand.  This operator only uses a right operand. |

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators operate on the individual bits of an integer variable.
The operation is performed on each bit in the operand and the bit in the
same position in the other operand.  The results of a bitwise operation is
to set each bit in the resulting value to either 1 or 0.

In Java, the order of bits goes from the ***MSB*** is on the left and
the ***LSB*** is on the right.  If you were to number the positions of the bits,
the ***LSB***, a.k.a. the Least Significant Bit, is in position 0. The position
of each bit to the left increments by 1 until reaching ther ***MSB***, a.k.a.
the Most Significant Bit, is in position (_N_ - 1) where _N_ is the number of
bits in the unit of memory.

When the unit of memory holds a signed integer, the ***MSB*** holds the sign
bit.  It is 0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers.  This is
important with the bit shifting operators.

### Table 6: Bitwise Operators

| Symbol | Purpose | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| __&__  | bitwise AND  | Each resulting bit is set to 1 if bits in both operands are also 1. |
| __\|__ | bitwise OR   | Each resulting bit is set to 1 if one or both bits in both operands are set to 1. |
| __^__  | bitwise XOR  | Each resulting bit is set to 1 if the bit in one operand is 1 and the other one is 0. |
| __~__  | bitwise NOT  | This operator works on a single right operand.  Each resulting bit is set to the opposite value of the bit in the operand. |
| __&lt;&lt;__ | left shift  | The resulting bits are the bits of the left operand shifted from ***LSB*** towards the ***MSB*** by the number of bits represented by the right operand.  Each time the bits are shifted to the left, the ***MSB*** are dropped and the ***LSB*** are set to 0. |
| __&gt;&gt;__ | signed right shift | The resulting bits are the bits of the left operand shifted from ***MSB*** towards the ***LSB*** by the number of bits represented by the right operand.  The bits shifted past the ***LSB*** are dropped.  The ***MSB*** bits that are vacated by the shift are set to the value of the sign bit.  This means that after the shift, a negative number remains negative and a positive number remains positive. |
| __&gt;&gt;&gt;__ | unsigned right shift | The unsigned right shift is almost the same as a signed right shift.  The differences is that the ***MSB*** are set to 0.  This means that a positive value remains positive while a starting negative value becomes positive. |


## Ternary (Conditional) Operator

Unlike the other operators, the ternary operator takes three operands.  This
operator is basically shorthand for a simple:

***if (condition) valueIfTrue else valueIfFalse***

Where condition is a boolean expression and valueIfTrue and valueIfFalse
are expressions to be evaluated.

The syntax of this operator is

***condition __\?_ valueIfTrue __:__ valueIfFalse***

The primary use of the ternary operator is provide a notation that allows
a value that is depended on a boolean expression to be used where a
temporary variable would be needed.

Exampe:
```
int value = 0;

if ( A && B )
{
    value = C + D;
}
else
{
    value = C - D;
}

foobar(value);
```
verses this
```
foobar( (A && B) ? (C + D) : (C - D) );
```
