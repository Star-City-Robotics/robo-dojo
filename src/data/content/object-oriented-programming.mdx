# Object Oriented Programming

## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

Most of the early programming languages were **Procedural Languages** which
means that the focus is on the sequence of instructions.  The data was secondary
to the methods, functions, and subroutines.  Examples of these languages are
C, FORTRAN, COBOL, and Pascal.

**Object Oriented** programming languages, such as C++ and Java, the focus is
on the data.  The data takes the form of _objects_.  Objects have two primary
features: properties and behavior.

The properties of an object, also called state, are values of the object.
For example, if we have a object that represents a ball, some of its properties
might be size, weight, colors, sport.  These properties may be stored
directly in an object or may be derived.  Lets say that the properties of
size and weight are stored as variables in the object.  We could derive the
property of density from the size and weight properties.

The behavior of an object are done through methods in the object which are
called _class methods_.  A method is what other programming languages would
call a function or a subroutine.  The basic difference between the names is
that in object oriented programming a method exists within an object and
a function or subroutine does not.

**Note:** A subroutine is basically a function that does not return a value.

In our example of ball object, some possible behaviors might be bounce(),
throw(), catch(), and hold().  Calling any of these methods may change
properties of the object, such properties as location and velocity. A
_class method_ can also change the properties of other objects if those
objects are passed to the _class method_.

## Java, an Object Oriented Language

Java is a programming language that was designed to a strict object oriented
programming language.  By strict we mean that everything is an object.

There is a partial exception to this.  There are primative data types
that store values of integers, real numbers, boolean variables.  This is
a partial exception because these data types can only be defined inside
of an object data type.  An object data type is called a **class**.

Functions do not exist in Java because they cannot be defined outside of
a class.  Therefore, all functions are **methods** that are defined in
the class data type.
