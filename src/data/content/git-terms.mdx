# Git Terminology

Source Control Management has its own set of terms that you need
to understand in order to use git.  The following are a list of
terms used by SCM and git.  Descriptions and explinations of these
terms will be provided in future lessons.

- ***Repository***
- ***Branch***
- ***Pulling***
- ***Pushing***
- ***Commits***
- ***Merging***
- ***Pull Request***

There are also all the git commands to learn.  This good thing 
about learning the git commands is that you only need to learn 
a couple of commands to get started.  The other commands can
be learned when they are needed.
