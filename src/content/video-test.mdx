## Advanced MDX Features Demo

This section showcases various MDX features that can be used in our robotics learning content.

### Direct HTML Rendering

You can embed custom HTML directly in MDX:

<div
  style={{
    background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)",
    padding: "20px",
    borderRadius: "8px",
    color: "white",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}
>
  <h3 style={{ margin: "0 0 10px 0" }}>Custom HTML Component</h3>
  <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
    This is rendered directly as HTML with custom styling!
  </p>
</div>

### Admonitions and Quotes

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Always test your robot code in a simulation environment before deploying to real hardware. This saves time and prevents damage to expensive components.

> **⚠️ Safety Warning**: When working with robots, always ensure proper safety measures are in place. Never leave a robot running unattended during testing.

> **📚 Learning Note**: The best way to learn robotics is through hands-on projects. Start simple and gradually increase complexity.

#### Blockquotes with Attribution

> "The future of robotics is not about replacing humans, but about augmenting human capabilities and creating new possibilities for collaboration."
